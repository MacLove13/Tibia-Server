# Tibia on Rails (Server)

This is a project I did for study purposes only.

The project is a Tibia server in TypeScript with a functional Web-client in React.

This is not a complete server, it only has some basic implementations such as connection via web sockets, multiplayer character movement, enemies walking around the map, the map can be accessed through the Client itself in the browser (a simple map editor), chat, weapons, food and potions and some other small implementations, far from being something actually playable.
